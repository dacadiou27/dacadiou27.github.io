            when I encounter the opportunity to do some snorkeling. I always have a bathing suit in the car during
            a road trip, just in case! A nice bay with some beautiful tropical fishes could be around the corner!</p>

                                    stripes,
                                    tapered nose, and tall thin
                                    dorsal fin, are one of the most recognizable fish on the reef. Moorish idols can
                                    grow fairly large, attaining a length
                                    of over
                                    eight inches
                                    – and that on a primary diet of sponges. Pretty awesome, right</p>

                                    Hawaii’s reefs,
                                    pushing itself around
                                    using the fins on its back and belly. Its body is shaped almost like a parallelogram
                                    with a blue
                                    mustache, a blue and black striped cap, and a fan-shaped tail attached by a dark
                                    sideways “V”
                                    outlined
                                    in gold (the wedge). These fish are usually shy, but if guarding a nest, they have
                                    been known to
                                    bite
                                    snorkelers. Their magnificent Hawaiian name – a tongue-twister for many non-native
                                    speakers –
                                    has
                                    elements meaning “to stitch pieces together” and “nose like a pig.” When stressed,
                                    these fish
                                    can
                                    make a

                                <p class="card-text">Easy to spot on the reef, the longnose butterflyfish is mostly
                                    bright yellow, with a black bandit’s mask, white chin, a black spot beneath the
                                    tail, and of course – a very long nose! These fish come in two “flavors”: Common,
                                    which bite off bits of creatures like sea stars for food; and Big, which eat small
                                    shrimp. The longnose butterflyfish has a long nose along with the longest known fish
                                    name in the Hawaiian language! It’s called the lauwiliwilinukunukuoi’oi.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Raccoon butterflyfish are so named for their black, raccoon-like
                                    masks. Mostly orange-yellow, they have a white headband, dark stripes that run
                                    diagonally along their sides, and a wide black stripe outlined in yellow that looks
                                    a little like a scarf thrown up over their shoulders. These fish usually cruise the
                                    reef coupled up or in large schools, but they can be seen alone. These guys eat
                                    spineless marine organisms like worms, sea anemones, and other things that humans
                                    think are gross and slimy but are actually really interesting when you take a closer
                                    look.!</p>

                                <p class="card-text">According to John P. Hoover, fish identifier extraordinaire,
                                    Achilles Tangs are named after “the Greek warrior Achilles, who symbolizes youthful
                                    grace, beauty, and valor.” Easily found cropping algae, these beautiful fish are
                                    larger than many living on the reef. They are primarily dark colored, and they sport
                                    a distinctive bright orange teardrop patch just before the base of their tail. A
                                    wide orange bar also runs along the tail itself. Achilles tangs like to hang out
                                    right where waves spill over into the shallow reefs – an area known as the surge
                                    zone.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">The black triggerfish looks simply black at first glance, but get
                                    closer and you are in for a wonderful surprise! There are gorgeous blue and green
                                    lines that radiate from their eyes at times, and if the fish turns sideways and you
                                    can see it catch the sunlight, the beauty and wonder of it will take your breath
                                    away! A neon blue line that looks like really cool caulking appears to attach their
                                    dorsal and caudal fins to the length of their bodies.</p>

            I do not bike as much as I should or want. But during the pandemic I was able to go
            many times with my 7 year old daughter on "long" bike rides along the river. I just enjoy the time
            shared with my family!</p>

        <h2>Rock Collecting</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Not everything needs to be professional, I just love to collect rocks and gems just because they
            look beautiful. I have 3 shelves of them at home. As a geologist, I could proceed with some scientific studies, but I
            prefer to admirer them for their natural beauty.</p>
